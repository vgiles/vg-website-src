If we 'quilt' the floating signifiers through 'Communism', for example, 'class struggle' confers a precise but fixed signification to all other elements:
to democracy (so-called 'real democracy' as opposed to 'bourgeois formal democracy' as a legal form of exploitation);
to feminism (the exploitation of women as resulting from the class-conditioned division of labour);
to ecologism (the destruction of natural resources as a logical consequence of profit-orientated capitalist production);
to the peace movement (the principal danger to peace is adventuristic imperialism), and so on.
