  <p><b>How ought one live? (2019)
  </b><br/>
  Vincent Giles</p>
  <p>Instructions:<br/>
    Click or tap to regenerate at performer's leisure. Performance ends when the performer decides it ends.
    Performer should consider space and time relative to the screen size and navigate the text top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Octaves are equivalent.
    Performer should take cues from the text shade as to things like dynamic, articulation. This is a structured improvisation.
    Performer should attempt to frame the entire score in their window/browser.     <i>Perf. score v. 0.8</i>
