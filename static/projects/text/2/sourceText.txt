How Might One Live?
It’s an odd question, in some sense; a question we don’t ask ourselves very often.
We get up in the morning, we brush our teeth,
we crawl into our clothing, and burn our days as though
it were impossible to live any other way, as though this
particular life were the only one to be lived.
As though the universe were so constructed that it required our lives to unfold in this way and in no other.
Of course that isn’t what we tell ourselves. Our stories are always filled with choices, with crossroads
and tangents and directions of our own making. Our lives’ narratives, when we tell them to ourselves or to others,
are steeped in the discarding of certain futures and the embrace of others, in the construction of a world that is
to each of us uniquely our own because each of us has chosen it. But is that how we live? Is that how our lives,
so often conforming, so often predictable, so often disappointing, come to be what they are?
