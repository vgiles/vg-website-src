*"For Vincent, truth and, from it, musical authenticity, comes not from the mystical or the subjective but from the search to be informed about the world and about the media with which the musician works."*
— Ian Parsons, PBS FM 106.7 (The Sound Barrier)

*"What is clear is that Giles' music is often intimately linked to the setting in which it is appreciated: there is an intentional blurring of the distinction between the content of the piece and the ambient noise of the space."*
– Jennifer Hauptman, Buzzcuts

*"Vincent Giles' Differing Dialogues is another adventure through the wilder sounds that the low flutes bring to the table … [He] paints an amazing landscape exploiting so many of the wondrous extended techniques offered by the instrumentation."*
– Shaun Barlow, flutetutor.com.au
