          This is an open/structured improvisation for solo voice (or multiple singers could perform from multiple iterations.)<br/>

          While the score should render effectively on most displays, it designed for iPad-sized screens or bigger, and smaller screens may omit the bottom-most information.<br/>

          Click or tap to regenerate at performer's leisure. Performance ends when the performer decides it ends.<br/>

          Performer should consider space and time relative to the screen size and navigate the text top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Octaves are equivalent.<br/>

          Performer should take cues from the text shade as to things like dynamic, articulation. This is a structured improvisation.<br/>

          The pitch material is arhythmic to give the performer the pitch relations between words only, with rhythm and other articulations defined in performance.<br/>

          Performer should attempt to frame the entire score in their window/browser.  <br/>
