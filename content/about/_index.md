Vincent Giles (Melbourne, 1985) is active in composition, improvisation, and installation art, and is informed by the physical properties of sound, experimental music, and technology. Vincent's work explores the boundaries of perception and performance, with particular focus on microsound and human or machine errors. Current projects include a long work for solo classical guitar, an installation piece that tracks skeleton movement with a phone camera, and developing a live-coding practice.
Recently completed projects include *The Moth and the Flame* for piano and voice, staged at Newcastle Fringe Festival in 2023 and *six figures signifying decay* for piano and electronics staged at Sydney Fringe Festival 2023. Vincent's notated work is published by Wirripang Australia and the Australian Music Centre, and has been recorded for Move Records. He co-founded and co-directed the Tilde New Music Festival and Academy since 2013, and currently serves on the executive committee of the Australasian Computer Music Association.

_"Vincent Giles' new piece, IMPULSE gave a new 21st century voice to field recordings, mostly gathered from his recent trip to Europe, flourishing and melding in a unsettled but vibrant electroacoustic language."_  
_— Ian Parsons, PBS FM 106.7_

_"What is clear is that Giles' music is often intimately linked to the setting in which it is appreciated: there is an intentional blurring of the distinction between the content of the piece and the ambient noise of the space."_  
_ – Jennifer Hauptman, Buzzcuts_

_"Vincent Giles' Differing Dialogues is another adventure through the wilder sounds that the low flutes bring to the table … [He] paints an amazing landscape exploiting so many of the wondrous extended techniques offered by the instrumentation."_  
_– Shaun Barlow, flutetutor.com.au_
